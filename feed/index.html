				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mind-share for building automotive apps have steadily been growing over the last few years to warrant a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/technology/detroit-embracing-new-auto-technologies-seeks-app-builders.html?smid=pl-share">recent article</a> in The NYT.  Two primary catalysts have started this trend.  First being the technology/capability with the launch of iOS and Android and app economy, and it&#8217;s major appeal to consumers.  Second the &#8217;07 economic downturn and rising gas prices since before that hit auto makers particularly hard in the wallets, they&#8217;re looking for high margin areas to grow their business.  Both forces are causing convergence of (personal/web) information and (in-vehicle) entertainment, or <em>infotainment</em> if you will.</p>
<p>So what we have essentially is an attempt to rethink or even Jerry-rig the consumer and mobile usage cases to translate into an in car environment, or even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device">BYOD</a> type of setup.</p>
<p>The three largest issues standing in it&#8217;s way:</p>
<p>1. Pace of automotive product development due to auto grade requirements and reliability testing<br />
New cars being sold today are still carrying middle-console technology that are at best 3 years old.  This is due to: 1) chip and component suppliers needing to auto-qualify their parts (~6-12 months), 2) automotive manufacturers to perform their own reliability testing beyond what is typical of consumer devices (~12 months), and 3) the unavoidable development time of said infotainment devices (~12 months at best).</p>
<p>2. Human usage factors<br />
The industry is still in it&#8217;s infancy of this technology use thus mistakes are common and natural, and often breaking of the rule &#8216;don&#8217;t fix what&#8217;s not broken&#8217;.  For instance in the first iteration, the infotainment device was a purely touch screen device.  Using this would be akin to texting while driving.  They were missing physical cues and knobs, design choices that seem so obvious only in hindsight.  While each mistake should get fixed in the next iteration, drivers will have to wait the above mentioned 3 years.</p>
<p>3. Lack of popular standards<br />
There are probably at least have a dozen proposed standards that propose to allow consumer devices to link and display on the in-vehicle display (allowing drivers to access their smartphone data/music playlists/phone contacts).  Which is fewer still than the number of app ecosystems each auto manufacturer is proposing to create for their drivers.  Developers and drivers will be rewarded or punished for whichever standards/ecosystems they decide to go with.</p>
<p>Ultimately, each industry goes through their own pace of development.  The auto industry is slow and aviation is much slower, both rightly so for sake of human safety.  In order to push the pace of innovation for non-critical systems however, producers should focus on the interfaces (human, electrical, and mechanical) and hardware requirements (temperature range, auto qualified, vibration, etc).  Publish defined interfaces and requirements and let the consumer device makers have at it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/intel-may-have-lost-the-iphone-battle-but-it-could-still-win-the-mobile-war/275825/">Excellent article</a> by The Atlantic describing Otellini&#8217;s perspective of the decision to pass on supplying chips for the iPhone before it was the iPhone.   And a succinct summary about Intel&#8217;s recent, present and future direction in respect to the mobile ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>ARM is an architecture. It&#8217;s a licensing company.  If I wanted to compete with ARM, I&#8217;d say let&#8217;s license Intel architecture out to anyone that wants it and have at it and we&#8217;ll make our money on royalties. And we&#8217;d be about a third the size of the company.  [It's] important for me, as the CEO, that I tell our employees who it is that we have to compete with and who we&#8217;re focused on, and I don&#8217;t want them focused on ARM. I want them focused on Qualcomm or Nvidia or TI.  Or if someone like Apple is using ARM to build a phone chip, I want our guys focused on building the best chip for Apple, so they want to buy our stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/05/a-look-at-haswell/">Haswell</a> and Intel&#8217;s eventual move to 14nm end-13/early-14, in effort to reach the <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6655/intel-brings-core-down-to-7w-introduces-a-new-power-rating-to-get-there-yseries-skus-demystified">4W TDP</a> threshold they will finally bring a gun to a gun battle (for tablets).  But they will still need another generation to truly battle for the smartphone market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Google vs Oracle Ruling</h3>
<p>Recent rulings reported by TechCrunch regarding Java API copyright should be a relief to developers.  The ruling states that identical header files and API calls do not infringe against the original developer, granted that the underlying methods are not a copy which should be trivial for developers to work-around.  +1 for innovation.</p>

<h3>Divshot WYSIWYG Website Creator</h3>
<p>Having had the chance to try out Divshot&#8217;s web editor public beta, their ease of controls and intuitive layout designed around the popular <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter bootstrap framework</a> has been truly impressive.  They don&#8217;t plan to stop here however, and are expected to integrate more themes and frameworks into their editor.  And congratulations to them on being <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/web-app-interface-builder-divshot-raises-1-1-million-seed-round/">awarded $1.1M in seed funding</a>.  Should be very exciting to see what they might do with this cash infusion.</p>

<h3>An In-Depth Comparison Between iOS Map Frameworks: Apple MapKit vs. Google Maps SDK</h3>
<p>Just as the title says, a clear pros and cons, and gotchas, for deciding between between Apple and Google solutions on iOS.  If you can&#8217;t decide then you can use both (for double the development cost) just as <a href="http://planefinder.net/">Plane Finder</a> has done on their app.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.howtogomo.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519" style="border: 1px solid #666;" alt="How To Go Mobile" src="http://www.warewoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Capture.png" width="854" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clean calculator site made by Google to walk you through the click counts and purchase percentages, from online views to offline sales, and come up with a dollar figure of what your mobile strategy is worth.</p>
<p>The overall formula is a summation of 4 separate components:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;" data-mce-mark="1">In store sales started from mobile search</span></li>
<li>Phone sales started from mobile search</li>
<li>Mobile app download value started from search</li>
<li>Cross-device (desktop e-commerce) sales started from mobile search</li>
</ol>
<p>The each of the components are basically click-through percentages multiplied by average dollar amounts, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>No. of mobile searches and clicks</p>
<p><strong>X</strong>  Store visit % (or phone call %, app download rate, desktop e-commerce sales, etc)</p>
<p><strong>X</strong>  Avg. purchase $ (or phone purchase $, app lifetime value, online sales, etc)</p>
<p>=  component value</p></blockquote>
<br />
<p>You can do this on the back of a napkin, or use a fancy walk-through calculator like this site (which might give you some additional insights since they break down several other metrics as well).  In either case, this is part of the due diligence businesses should perform when deciding their mobile strategy, and potentially lost opportunity cost for not taking action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following link forwarded to me by a self-admitted Apple fanboy, with his admittance on thoughts of trying out Android after the current contract is up.  Clearly, by most measurements iOS is the more lucrative of the app platforms, which is why at Warewoof we continue to build our tools to support it.  But the recent Apple mishaps and Google&#8217;s salvos have added gravity to the trends we&#8217;re seeing.</p>
<p>Interestingly I think the new gmail is the best email app on iOS now, chrome is the best browser app, and Google maps is the best map app. So by properly investing their efforts to make these apps right, we&#8217;re seeing Google strategy shape up by competing at the customer usage/data level.  And not necessarily for the platform, evident also by the fact that Google doesn&#8217;t seem to care to make any money selling android. Apple meanwhile is all about maintaining high hardware margins, and if they don&#8217;t improve their own service offerings such as maps then they could eventually be relegated hardware makers for Google services, like Samsung.</p>

<br />
<p><strong>Top 25 US developers account for half of app revenue &#8211; Canalys<br />
</strong>Collectively made more than $60 million in 20 days in November, and with the exception of Pandora they are all game developers (such as Zynga, Electronic Arts, Disney, Kabam, Rovio, Glu, Gameloft and Storm8’s TeamLava).  Which is great because this the pie is only half eaten, for the rest of the would-be-hit-game developers.<br />
